T00044=He entered pour
T00045=\u3010Definition\u3011: he entered led before pour is also called the head, is usually characterized by the head relative to shoulder moves forward,often appeared in the worker, sitting in front of the computer is not correct sedentary, often use a mobile phone,bad posture of the crowd. 
T00046=\u3010Harm\u3011: from the physiological anatomy of a head before led will usually cause cervical physiological curvature of the straightened,low before the head forward to 15 \u00b0, cervical pressure increases 30 pounds, 30 pounds is equivalent to a three year old child's weight, we can imagine at this moment the cervical spine was how much pressure! The cervical vertebral injury caused by the cervical vertebral injury caused by the cervical vertebral injury caused by the cervical vertebra is caused by the cervical vertebra.
T00047=The pelvis forward
T00048=\u3010definition\u3011 : the front of the pelvis is the pathological phenomenon of the pelvic position deviation. The most obvious symptoms of the front of the pelvis are posterior protrusion, the waist-hip ratio, BMI and weight are in normal range, and the abdomen is still convex.
T00049=\u3010Harm\u3011 : the pelvis forward for a long time, not only affect beautiful, serious will aggravate the burden of lower back and neck, which brings the problems such as pain and neck pain, pelvic forward can make the activities of each part is restricted, resulting in muscle recession. As the pelvis supports the abdomen, it has important functions to protect the viscera and reproductive organs. Pelvic deformation can affect the viscera and reproductive organs in the pelvis. The tilt of the pelvis has distorted the shape of the uterus, ovaries and intestines, so that the fluid flow can be impeded or even partially lost. In addition, because the pelvis can pull the muscle around the waist to expand to the left and right, the waist nerve is oppressed and causes back pain.
T00050=High and low shoulder
T00051=\u3010definition\u3011 : the essence of high and low shoulders is deformity of the spine. The causes of high and low shoulders are bilateral muscle imbalance, scoliosis, chronic poor posture, congenital hyperscapularis.
T00052=\u3010hazard\u3011 : high and low shoulder is not only a simple imbalance of the body, but most importantly, it causes the spine to deform. High and low shoulder the main hazards are: 1: near the neck and shoulder pain due to shoulder muscle strains, or spinal degeneration caused by scoliosis, further make cervical lateral bending, easy to produce the neck shoulder a chronic pain. Second: chronic headaches can spread the pain to the head and even cause chronic headaches when the pain in the shoulders of the neck worsens. If you are suffering from a nameless headache, it is likely to be caused by long-term high and low shoulders. Three: cervical vertebra degradation when the problem of high and low shoulder cannot be solved, long year position is incorrect, make cervical vertebra is subjected to excessive load, can cause cervical vertebra place to degenerate at last, even form the bone spur. Four: lumbar pain, leg length differ height shoulder to cause pelvic displacement, make waist tissue muscle imbalance, cause waist pain. At the same time, pelvic displacement can change the length of the legs, resulting in the appearance of the legs.
T00053=hunchback
T00054=\u3010definition\u3011 : the humpback is a more common form of spinal deformity, which is a morphological change caused by the posterior axon of the thoracic vertebra. Mainly because of weak back muscle, loose and weak.
T00055=\u3010hazard\u3011 : 1. A hunchback creates tense muscles that can cause shoulder and neck soreness. The most severe compression of the cervical spine can cause headaches and numbness in the arms. 2: humpback reduce cervical curvature, stiff, lead to insufficient supply, breathing is not smooth, oxygen consumption decreased, energy waste, affect the body function, easy to accumulate in the body of toxins. 3: the hump will cause the diaphragm to be in a state of tension, resulting in the compression of the aorta and vena cava, which will increase the burden of cardiac work.
T00056=Pelvic tilt back
T00057=\u3010definition\u3011 : when the pelvis is tilted to the front of the pelvis, the upper end of the pubic bone will be backward and the lower end of the pubic bone will move forward. The posterior pelvic position is a humpback and hip droop.
T00058=\u3010hazard\u3011 : this stance causes the centre of gravity to move forward, allowing the knee to carry more weight, which may eventually lead to increased injury chances and serious wear and tear. In addition, because pelvic area is the important position that carries reproductive function and supports viscera, so pelvic hind pour can also affect endocrine and physiology circulation and so on.
T00059=Head CeWai
T00060=\u3010definition\u3011 : the tendency of the head to shift to one side in the natural state is mainly caused by chronic bad habits or improper training. The lateral muscle fascia is overpressed or balanced on both sides.
T00061=\u3010hazard\u3011 : the head side tilt causes uneven stress on both sides, can lead to neck pain and headache, dizziness and other symptoms. Long-term head position is not easy to cause cervical degeneration, it needs to be corrected.
